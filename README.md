# LAT101 Notes
These mainly have to do with morphology due to Latin's fairly regular inflection system. My notes on syntax are either on paper or in my mind.

Organization:
- `notes.py` - where the actual business logic of the morphology covered so far is coded
- `vocab.py` - definitions of vocabulary covered so far - lexes in comments
- `test.py` - (edit and) run this file to generate output
